# Movie Marketplace

### This is a mock project for the Github Basics presentation


Our mock project will be a online website where visitors can browse and purchase movies from an online catalogue. 

Currently there are three pages to the project:

- home (`home.py`),
- moveList (`movieList.py`), and
- checkout (`checkout.py`).
